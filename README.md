## Overview

The **goal** of EcoMetrics is to help tutors and students doing *Basic Econometrics* and *Basic Regression*.

The package helps you to:

1. Regression Analysis:

- Perform ordinary least squares (OLS) regression for estimating relationships between variables.
- Include tools for hypothesis testing (e.g., significance of coefficients, F-tests).

2. Diagnostics and Model Evaluation:
   
- Test econometric models for assumptions such as:
- Homoscedasticity (constant variance).
- Normality of residuals.
- Autocorrelation (e.g., using the Durbin-Watson test).
- Multicollinearity.
- Evaluate goodness-of-fit metrics (e.g., R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, AIC, BIC).

3. ARIMA time series models
